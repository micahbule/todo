# Sample To-Do Project

## Back-end Assumptions
You have already created your database. In the example, I'm using the following details:
* Database Username: `postgres` (this is normally the default user)
* Database Name: `todo-test` (change this to whatever database name you created via PG Admin)
* Database Host: `localhost`
* Database Password: `SomeSecurePassword` (change this to whatever your DB user password is)
* *To-Do Items Table Name: `todoitems`* (change accordingly in queries)
